# Combee

Combee is a proof of concept framework for safely integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into physical systems.  It's also a fun little robot you can talk to, and yes it is named after the pokemon.  

Note, this is all being rewritten for DEFCON32, so if you want to view the old code that we wrote earlier this year, go [here](./old/)


Notes for me:

- Set USBC to PWR adapter to 5V for servo board
- Set USB C to PWR adapter to 9V for motors
- For motors, from connectors POV, Power is left most pin, and ground is right next to it
